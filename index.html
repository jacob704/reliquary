						<h4>“Your life’s short, don’t ever question the length. It’s cool to cry, don’t ever question your strength” -Mac Miller, REMember</h4>
						<h4>During his life, Mac Miller was a beacon of positivity for many people.  His songs were always particularly resonant to those who struggle with mental health problems and substance abuse.  He preached positivity, forgiveness, strength, and resilience.  His discography spans over 10 years, an impressive feat for any artist, but what is truly remarkable about Mac Miller is that we are able to witness him growing up through his music.  He rapped challenges with addiction and depression and about overcoming the trials we face on a daily basis.   Later in his life, he became an outspoken feminist and advocate for the marginalized and disenfranchised.  He was  an icon of kindness, positivity, and love, and it is a tragedy he was taken from the world so soon.</h4>
						<h4>“No matter where life takes me find me with a smile” -Mac Miller, Best Day Ever"</h4>
